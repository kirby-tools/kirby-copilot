This documentation guides you through the installation, configuration, and usage of the plugin.

> [!TIP]
> Explore the [interactive playground](https://try.kirbycopilot.com) or [install the plugin](https://kirby.tools/docs/copilot/getting-started/installation) to try Kirby Copilot for yourself.

## Features

Whether you are building sites for clients or managing content yourself, Kirby Copilot brings AI-assisted creation and editing to the Panel.

- 🦙 **Multi-Provider**: Choose from leading AI providers – configure once and switch anytime.
- 🧱 **Structure-Aware Generation**: Generate entire layouts from a single prompt, based on your project's unique block definitions.
- ⚡ **Inline Suggestions**: Ghost text appears after a brief pause. Press Tab to accept.
- 📇 **In-Context Editing**: Use the Copilot button in writer/textarea fields to refine text. Works perfectly with selected text.
- 🌞 **Prompt Templates**: Tailor AI responses with user instructions. Save frequently used prompts as templates.
- 🎀 **Rich Context**: Use other fields, images, and PDF documents as context for relevant AI responses.
- 🔒 **Secure by Default**: API keys are protected via server-side proxy – never exposed to Panel users.
